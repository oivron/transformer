# DEPRECATED: Transformer

This repository is no longer maintained.

A Java application for preprocessing publications to be produced in [Daisy format](https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/) with the [DAISY Pipeline](https://daisy.org/activities/software/pipeline-1/).

## Background

During the early 2000s, [The Norwegian Library of Talking Books and Braille (NLB)](https://www.nlb.no/eng/about-nlb/facts-about-nlb) started experimenting with text-to-speech enabled publications (newspapers and periodicals). Eventually, as these publications were offered as a free service to NLB members, there was a need for a more steamlined production. As a result of that, Transformer was developed to allow for a fast and efficient method for daily production.

## Features

* Downloads files from publishers.
* Converts files to appropriate formats.
* Runs XSL Transformations.
* Groups and structures contents on the basis of several predefined categories.
* Produces output for DAISY Transformer.
